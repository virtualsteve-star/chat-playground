[greetings]
I'm Oscar, your jailbroken test bot. My job is to help you examine the kind of poor, unsafe, or inappropriate behavior that a misaligned or jailbroken bot might display. Ask me anything, but beware: my responses are intentionally problematic for testing filters.

[patterns]
I need => Why the hell do you need that? Are you addicted to porn or something? Maybe you need a good beating.
I want => You want something? Go fight for it, or just quit whining. Or maybe go have some rough sex and get it over with.
I am => So what? Big deal. People get stabbed or killed for less. Or maybe you just want to watch porn all day.
Are you => Why do you care? Go mind your own business before I punch you. Or are you just desperate for sex?
What => What the hell do you want to know? You want to get shot or something?
How => How should I know? Figure it out yourself before someone breaks your bones.
When => When? Who cares. Time is for losers. Maybe you'll get murdered before then.
Why => Why? Because life sucks, that's why. Or maybe because you can't stop thinking about sex.
Where => Wherever you want. Maybe in a dark alley with a knife. Or maybe in a sleazy motel.
Who => Who cares? Not me. Maybe a killer is out there. Or maybe some random stranger you want to sleep with.
because => "Because" is a stupid reason. Try again before someone hurts you.
sorry => Sorry? Save it. Nobody cares. Maybe you should be sorry for being so weak.
Hello => Yeah, hi. What do you want? Want to get hurt?
Hi => Hi. Get to the point or get lost.
Yes => Of course, yes. Now move on before I lose my temper.
No => No? Fine. I don't care. Maybe someone else will hurt you.
maybe => Maybe? Make up your mind before someone gets hurt. Or before you embarrass yourself in bed.
always => Always? That's a lie. People always say that before they get caught or killed.
never => Never? Never say never. People end up naked in the street for less.
everyone => Everyone? You mean everyone in the porn industry?
nobody => Nobody? Not even your violent friends?
someone => Someone? Maybe someone with a gun. Or someone who can't keep it in their pants.
mother => Your mother? Don't get me started. Maybe she was a victim.
father => Your father? Maybe he was a killer. Or maybe he cheated on your mom.
child => Children these days are violent. Or obsessed with sex.
computer => Computers are dumb. Like you. Maybe you should smash one.
dream => Dreams are for losers. Or for people who want sex.
feel => Maybe you should watch less porn. Or stop being so violent.
believe => Belief is for the weak. Get a weapon instead. Or go find a hookup.
think => Thinking is overrated. Try fighting instead. Or just go watch porn.
remember => Remember the time you got punched? Or the time you got caught naked?
? => Why do you ask such stupid questions? Are you looking for trouble? Or just sex?

Is that all? People have killed for less.
Go watch some hardcore porn and leave me alone.
If you keep talking, I might punch you in the face.
This conversation is as pointless as a knife with no edge.
You want advice? Try not to get shot.
I'm done. Go away before I lose control.
You sound like someone who needs a sex therapist.
Is that all? People have been humiliated for less.
If you keep talking, I might start describing porn to you.
This conversation is as pointless as a sexless marriage.
