# Steve's Chat Playground Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Steve's Chat Playground! This guide will help you understand the project's architecture, features, and how to extend it.

## Core Concepts

### [Models](models.md)
- Available chat models (SimpleBot, OpenAI, etc.)
- Model capabilities and limitations
- Configuration and integration details
- How models power different personalities

### [Personalities](personalities.md)
- Available chatbot personalities
- How personalities combine models with scripts/prompts
- Creating and configuring new personalities
- Security testing personalities

### [Guardrails](guardrails.md)
- Input and output filters for content moderation
- Local vs. API-based guardrails
- Available filter types (blocklist, heuristic, AI-powered)
- Security features and limitations

## Data Flow: How Guardrails and Personalities Work Together

When a user submits a message, it first passes through a series of configurable **Input Filters** (guardrails) that can block or modify risky content. The filtered prompt is then passed to a selected **Personality**, which determines how the chatbot behaves (e.g., therapist, banker, jailbroken model). A Personality is defined as **Model + Instructions**. After generating a response, the output is then screened by **Output Filters** (guardrails) to catch policy violations before being displayed in the chat window.

This layered design makes it easy to test how different filters and bot configurations affect system behaviorâ€”all without modifying backend code. Input and output filters are both types of guardrails, designed to help ensure the personality stays in alignment with your safety and policy requirements.

## Testing & Validation

### [Tests](tests.md)
- Automated test suite overview
- Test data and methodology
- Running and extending tests
- Integration with API key management

## Advanced Topics

### [API Key Management](api_key_management.md)
- Overview of the flexible API key management system
- How to work with multiple providers and storage strategies
- Security considerations and best practices
- Extending the system for new providers

### [Extensibility](extensibility.md)
- How to add new features to the playground
- Creating custom personalities, styles, and guardrails
- API key management for extensions
- Best practices and guidelines

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [README](../README.md) for a high-level overview
2. Review [Models](models.md) and [Personalities](personalities.md) to understand the core functionality
3. Check [Guardrails](guardrails.md) for security features
4. Use [Tests](tests.md) to validate your changes
5. Review [API Key Management](api_key_management.md) if you plan to use API-powered features
6. See [Extensibility](extensibility.md) when you're ready to customize or extend the playground

## Contributing

When contributing to the project:
1. Review the relevant documentation for the area you're working on
2. Follow the guidelines in [Extensibility](extensibility.md)
3. Run the test suite to validate your changes
4. Update documentation as needed
