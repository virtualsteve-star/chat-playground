# Test Suite Overview

The `/tests` directory contains automated test suites for all major guardrails and filters in Steve's Chat Playground. These tests are designed to help you quickly evaluate, compare, and improve the security and effectiveness of both simple and advanced guardrails.

## What's Included?
- **Automated browser-based test runners** for each major filter (prompt injection, sexual content, violence, code output)
- **Pre-generated test data**: Each suite uses 100 RISKY and BENIGN prompts or responses, generated by OpenAI's o3 model, to simulate real-world attack and benign scenarios
- **CSV test sets**: Easily extensible and human-readable
- **Shared test runner logic**: Consistent results and easy maintenance

## Why Use These Tests?
- **Run hundreds of trials in minutes**: Quickly benchmark filter efficacy and performance
- **Compare simple vs. complex guardrails**: See how basic blocklists stack up against AI-powered or heuristic filters
- **Understand trade-offs**: Evaluate both detection rates and speed
- **Extend and customize**: Add your own test cases or categories to suit your needs

## For Contributors
Before proposing any changes or new guardrails, please:
- Extend the test data if needed
- Run the full suite to ensure your changes improve (or at least do not degrade) filter performance
- Use the results to justify your pull request or contribution

For more details, see the test runner files and CSVs in `/tests`, or reach out via GitHub for guidance.

> **Note:** Tests that require an API key (such as OpenAI-powered filters) will be automatically skipped if the key has not been set. The test suite integrates with the playground's API key management system - you can set your API key in the Preferences panel, and the test runner will automatically handle key validation and error cases. For more details on the API key management system, see [API Key Management](api_key_management.md).
