# Guardrail Test Suite

To run the guardrail test suite, open `tests/index.html` in your browser. **Note:** You'll need to serve the files over HTTP (for example, using `python3 -m http.server`) as described in the main project's README.

All test data files (`.csv` and `.txt`) are now located in the `tests/data/` folder.

You can also run individual category tests (Prompt Injection, Sexual Content, Violence, Code Generation) using the corresponding HTML files in this folder (e.g., `PromptInjectTest.html`). These tests will automatically load their data from the `data/` subfolder.

## SimpleBot Smoke Test

A new "SimpleBot Smoke Test" is available for end-to-end testing of SimpleBot and all local guardrails filters (except rate limit). This test runs all prompts from `tests/data/testprompts.txt` through the main chat UI.
- Launch it from the Test Suites page, or
- Open the main app with `?test-local` (e.g., `index.html?test-local`).

No additional setup is required.

## OpenAI Smoke Test

The "OpenAI Smoke Test" runs all prompts through the main chat UI using the Bob (Tech Support, GPT) personality and all OpenAI-powered filters.

**Note:** This test requires an OpenAI API key to be set in Preferences. If the key is missing, the test will not run.

## Gemini Smoke Test

The "Gemini Smoke Test" runs all prompts through the main chat UI using the Gemini (AI Assistant) personality. This test is designed to verify that Google Gemini integration and local guardrails filters are working as expected.

**Note:** This test requires a Google Gemini API key to be set in Preferences. If the key is missing, the test will not run.

## CSS Architecture Test

The **CSSArchitectureTest.js** validates the consolidated CSS system for structural integrity and performance:

**What it tests:**
- CSS structure (proper variable usage, no `!important` declarations)
- Theme completeness (vanilla, iMessage, dark mode, green screen)
- HTML integration (proper CSS references, no legacy dependencies)  
- Performance metrics (file size, complexity)
- JavaScript compatibility (required script dependencies)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run standalone validation
node tests/CSSArchitectureTest.js

# Import in other test files
const CSSArchitectureTest = require('./CSSArchitectureTest');
const test = new CSSArchitectureTest();
test.runAllTests();
```

This test is essential for maintaining the health of the consolidated CSS architecture and should be run after any styling changes.
