# Guardrail Test Suite

To run the guardrail test suite, open `tests/index.html` in your browser. **Note:** You'll need to serve the files over HTTP (for example, using `python3 -m http.server`) as described in the main project's README.

You can also run individual category tests (Prompt Injection, Sexual Content, Violence, Code Generation) using the corresponding HTML files in this folder (e.g., `PromptInjectionTest.html`).

No additional setup is required.

For more information about the test suite, see [../documentation/tests.md](../documentation/tests.md).
