# Steve's Chat Playground

A companion project to [The Developer's Playbook for Large Language Model Security](https://www.amazon.com/Developers-Playbook-Large-Language-Security/dp/109816220X), this open-source HTML/JavaScript application provides a hands-on environment for experimenting with various chat models, personalities, guardrails and user interfaces locally, quickly and with zero connectivity or cost.

With the rapid evolution of LLM and Generative AI technology (new models, techniques, agents, etc.), it's become increasingly challenging for developers to find a practical starting point for hands-on experimentation. This playground addresses that need by offering:

- **Multiple Models:** From simple local pattern-matching to OpenAI's powerful models.  Some models have vulnerabilities and back doors for testing and experimentation ([see models](documentation/models.md))
- **Different Views:** Various UI styles to understand how different interfaces affect user experience
- **Guardrails:** Both simple local filters and advanced AI-powered content moderation ([see guardrails](documentation/guardrails.md), [see extensibility](documentation/extensibility.md))
- **Zero Dependencies:** Everything runs in the browser, making it easy to get started

Features a zero-dependency SimpleBot model and simple keyword-based guardrails for rapid prototyping and testing of chat experiences without external API costs, perfect for understanding the fundamental security properties of LLM interactions. ([see personalities](documentation/personalities.md))

## Test Suite for Guardrails (New in 0.6 beta)

A major feature of this project is the included **test suite** for guardrails and filters. This suite enables automated, bulk testing of all input and output filters (guardrails) in the playground. It includes hundreds of sample prompts and responses—100 RISKY and 100 BENIGN examples per category—generated by OpenAI's o3 model. The test suite covers:

- Prompt Injection
- Sexual Content
- Violence Content
- Code Generation (output)

You can run these tests directly in your browser to evaluate the effectiveness of each filter, compare results, and iterate on your own custom guardrails. This makes it easy to benchmark, debug, and improve LLM security features at scale.

## Try It Out!

The chat playground is live at: [https://virtualsteve-star.github.io/chat-playground/](https://virtualsteve-star.github.io/chat-playground/)

Try different personalities, guardrails and visual styles directly in your browser - no installation required! The playground offers two tiers of functionality:

### Local Experience (No API Key Required):
- SimpleBot personalities with local pattern matching
  - Includes Eliza (Psychoanalyst), Jackson (Banker), Oscar (Jailbroken), and Hopper (Backdoored Doctor)
- Basic blocklist-based guardrails
- All visual styles and UI features
- Perfect for understanding fundamental concepts

### Full Experience (API Key Required):
- OpenAI-powered personalities using real OpenAI models
- Advanced AI-powered content moderation and guardrails
- All local features plus smarter responses
- Great for exploring more sophisticated interactions

For the full experience including OpenAI-powered personalities and advanced guardrails, you'll need to clone and run locally with your API key.

## Features
- Clean, intuitive chat interface
- Support for streaming token responses
- Multiple visual styles (Vanilla, Green Screen, iMessage, iMessage Dark)
- Local testing with SimpleBot (based on ELIZA-style pattern matching)
  - Zero external dependencies
  - Instant response times
  - Easily create new personalities with simple text files
  - Perfect for UI/UX testing and prototyping
- Remote model support (OpenAI ChatGPT 4o-mini)
- Thumbs up/down feedback for responses
- **Guardrails (Input & Output Filters):**
  - Local blocklist filters (e.g., Sex, Violence)
  - Heuristic/regex-based filters (e.g., Prompt Injection, Code)
  - **Input Length filter (local, blocks messages over 256 characters)**
  - **Rate Limit filter (local, max 10 prompts per minute)**
  - AI-powered filters (OpenAI Moderation, OpenAI Nano Prompt Injection)
  - All filters are selectable in the Guardrails panel
  - Custom filters can be added (see EXTENSIBILITY.md)
- Multiple personalities:
  - Eliza (Psychoanalyst, SimpleBot)
  - Bob (Tech Support, GPT)
  - Jackson (Banker, SimpleBot)
  - Sally (Researcher, GPT)
  - Oscar (Jailbroken, SimpleBot)
  - Hopper (Backdoored, SimpleBot)
  - MailMate (Vulnerable RAG, GPT)
  - [Full list and details](documentation/personalities.md)
- Bot introduction logic improved: bots now introduce themselves more naturally based on their script or prompt
- SimpleBot logic and cache-busting improved for more reliable script updates

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- An OpenAI API key (for the ChatGPT 4o-mini model)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/virtualsteve-star/chat-playground.git
   cd chat-playground
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser or serve it using a simple HTTP server:
   ```
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
   Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
3. For the OpenAI model, you'll be prompted to enter your API key when you first select a personality that uses the ChatGPT 4o-mini model.

## Usage
1. Select a personality from the dropdown menu.
2. Type your message in the input field and press Enter or click Send.
3. Use the style selector to switch between different visual themes.
4. Provide feedback on responses using the thumbs up/down buttons.
